📞 Operational Performance Analysis at CallMeMaybe Contact Center
📌 Brief Description

This project analyzes the performance of operators at the virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe, identifying inefficiency patterns based on key metrics such as missed calls, waiting times, and outbound call volume. The work integrates exploratory analysis, data visualization, and statistical testing to support data-driven operational improvements.

🎯 Objective and Context

The objective was to identify the least effective operators within the customer support system. Operators were considered inefficient if they exhibited high rates of missed inbound calls, long waiting times, or a low number of outbound calls.
This analysis provides supervisors with actionable insights to target training efforts and optimize resource allocation.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Jupyter Notebook
Techniques applied: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test, Mann–Whitney test), and data visualization.

📊 Key Results and Insights

A group of operators was identified with significantly higher missed call rates and longer waiting times than the overall average.

Hypothesis testing confirmed statistically significant differences in waiting times between efficient and inefficient operators (p < 0.05).

Scatter plot visualizations clearly revealed performance outliers and inefficiency trends.

Key learning: combining performance metrics with statistical testing offers a robust foundation for data-informed operational decision-making.
